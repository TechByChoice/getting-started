## Project Management and Roadmaps

### Overview

At OpenTBC, we employ a dynamic and collaborative approach to project management, ensuring that our projects remain aligned with our community's interests and our organization's goals. Our project management process is designed to be transparent, inclusive, and flexible, accommodating the diverse talents and contributions of our community members.

### Developing Roadmaps

Each project under OpenTBC has a roadmap that lives in Linear that outlines planned features, improvements, and milestones. These roadmaps are developed collaboratively by project maintainers, contributors, and the community. We encourage open discussions and feedback on roadmap proposals to ensure that our projects are responsive to community needs and aspirations. You'll be able to find all project Linear boards linked in the `readme.md` of each project.

Roadmaps are living documents, periodically reviewed and updated to reflect progress, learnings, and changing priorities. They serve as a guide for contributors and provide insight into the project's direction and future plans.

### Submitting a New Project

We are always looking for new and exciting projects to undertake. If you have an idea for a project that aligns with OpenTBC's mission and values, we encourage you to submit it as an issue in our [OpenTBC Issues](https://github.com/TechByChoice/OpenTBC/issues) repository. Here's how the process works:

1. **Submit Your Idea**: Create a new issue in the OpenTBC repository, providing a detailed description of your project idea, its goals, and how it can benefit the community.
2. **Community Voting**: Once submitted, the community will have the opportunity to review and vote on project ideas. Voting takes place at the end of each month, allowing everyone to participate in the decision-making process.
3. **Selection and Prioritization**: The project with the highest votes will be selected for development. Winning projects will be prioritized and assigned to cohorts or individual maintainers who express interest in leading the project outside of our cohort program.

This process ensures that our projects are community-driven and have the support and enthusiasm of our members from the outset.

***__This process is currently in its alpha state and is subject to changes over the next 2-3 months. We will update community members on these updates in Slack and email__***


We believe that our approach to project management and roadmaps empowers our community to take an active role in shaping the future of OpenTBC. By submitting project ideas, participating in votes, and contributing to roadmap discussions, every member has a voice in what we build together.
