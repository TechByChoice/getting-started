# Getting Started with Linear

Welcome to our guide on using Linear to track and manage your projects. Linear simplifies project management, allowing teams to focus on building great products. This guide is divided into sections to do a deep dive into how Project Managers, Developers, and Designers will use the tool.

## For Project Managers

### Setting Up Your Workspace

- **Create Projects**: Start by setting up projects for each of your team's current initiatives. Each project in Linear can correspond to a different product, feature, or any work area that requires separate tracking.

- **Define Workflows**: Customize workflows for each project to match your team's process. You can create stages like `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done` to reflect the stages of your workflow.

- **Manage Teams**: Organize your workspace by creating teams. Assign team members based on their roles and projects they are working on. This helps in distributing tasks effectively.

### Tracking Progress

- **Create Milestones**: Use milestones to mark significant checkpoints or releases. Milestones help in setting targets and measuring progress towards your project goals.

- **View Reports**: Utilize Linear’s reporting tools to generate insights on team performance, workload, and project progress. This data is crucial for making informed decisions and adjustments to your project plan.

- **Prioritize Tasks**: With Linear, you can easily prioritize tasks to ensure that critical issues are addressed first. Use labels and filters to sort tasks by priority, deadline, or any other criteria important to your project.

## For Developers

### Managing Tasks

- **Task Assignment**: Check the tasks assigned to you in the `My Tasks` section. This gives you a clear overview of your current workload and priorities.

- **Updating Task Status**: Regularly update the status of your tasks as you progress through the workflow. Moving tasks from `Todo` to `In Progress` and finally to `Review` or `Done` keeps everyone informed about the project's progress.

- **Branch Integration**: Take advantage of Linear’s integration with version control systems like Git. You can link branches and pull requests to tasks, making it easier to track code changes related to specific issues.

### Collaboration

- **Comment and Discuss**: Use the comment section in tasks to discuss implementations, ask questions, or provide updates. @mention team members to grab their attention or assign them tasks.

- **Review Code**: When tasks move into the `Review` stage, participate in code reviews to ensure quality and consistency. Share feedback directly in the linked pull requests.

## For Designers

### Task Management

- **Review Assignments**: Similar to developers, start your day by reviewing the tasks assigned to you. Prioritize tasks based on deadlines and project requirements.

- **Share Designs**: Use tasks to share your designs with the team. You can attach files or link to design tools like Figma, providing easy access to your work for feedback.

### Collaboration and Feedback

- **Gather Feedback**: Encourage team members to provide feedback on designs directly within tasks. Use comments to discuss design choices and iterate based on the team's input.

- **Work Closely with Developers**: Collaborate closely with developers to ensure that the implementation matches the design vision. Address any questions or concerns they might have about the designs.
